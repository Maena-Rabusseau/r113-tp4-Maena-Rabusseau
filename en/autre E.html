    <a href="/fr/autre F.html">Accueil en fran√ßais </a>
    <p>University life can be an exciting yet stressful time, especially for students facing new responsibilities.
        Intensive courses, tight deadlines, and the pressure to succeed can quickly become overwhelming. Learning to
        manage this stress is crucial to maintaining mental and physical balance.

        The first step in reducing stress is organizing one's schedule. Planning important tasks, breaking projects into
        smaller steps, and setting priorities help avoid procrastination, a major source of stress. Additionally,
        incorporating breaks throughout the day is vital. Whether it's practicing yoga, taking a walk, or simply
        breathing deeply, these moments help regain focus.

        Furthermore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is key. Getting enough sleep, eating well, and avoiding excessive
        caffeine or alcohol boost the ability to handle stress. Lastly, seeking support is essential. Talking with
        friends, a mentor, or even consulting a professional can provide valuable perspectives and solutions.

        Stress management is a skill that takes time to develop. By taking care of oneself, every student can not only
        succeed academically but also fully enjoy this enriching period of their life.</p>
